      <h1>Returns! What You Need to Know...</h1>

      <p>
        When a customer's item is returned, it is important to know what steps
        to take to process the return. Do you know how they paid? Was this a Net
        30? If so, has that invoice been paid-in-full or is it still open? All
        of these questions are important to answer before processing the return.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shopify:</b> If the order was paid in Shopify with either Shop or
        PayPal, then the refund must be processed in the same program. Remember
        that no refund can be given in the Shopify system until the business day
        after the purchase was made. Refunds are also not allowed for purchased
        that occurred over 6-months prior. This is due to the Shopify system
        process payouts at the end of the day. If a customer was charged for an
        item that did not ship, the shipping department will send a image of the
        picking sheet that contains the out-of-stock item with the word refund
        written next to the SKU number. The image must also contain the order
        number to allow the Operations department to identify the shipment in
        the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Manual or Payable Invoice:</b> If the customer was emailed a payable
        invoice or the payment was entered manual in the authorization software.
        The refund must be processed within the same system. The same 6-month
        limit applies to refunds in the authorization system. For out-of-stock
        items a refund maybe processed the same day, by making an adjustment to
        the order total. However, the system updates periodically throughout the
        day, and the shortage needs to be reported to Operations as soon as it
        is noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Net 30:</b> If the customer has a Net 30 account, the refund must be
        processed in the invoicing software. If the invoice is still open, it
        will be adjusted to remove the item. The Sales Rep and the customer must
        both be notified of the shortage and the invoice adjustment. If the
        invoice is paid, then a credit note shall be created and sent to the
        customer. Credit Notes must not be applied to open invoices, even if an
        exchange is being processed. This will cause the invoice amount due to
        be lowered caused shrinkage.
