      <h1>Return Merchandise Agreements</h1>
      <p>
        The Return Merchandise Agreement (RMA) is a critical part of the return
        process, because it is what brings the item back to us for inspection.
        Soon we will begin a two-month trial program that will not require the
        customer to return their item. Instead we will ask them the email a
        video of the bag in a destroyed state. This insures the bag is no longer
        in sellable condition, and allows use to reduce the overhead cost of
        shipping the item back to the warehouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can accept any item from return, however only damaged or defected
        items can be returned without a restocking fee. Below are some examples
        of returns that would encounter a restocking fee:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer changed their mind about the purchase</li>
        <li>Item does not fit as expected*</li>
        <li>Customer found a better price elsewhere</li>
        <li>Customer ordered the wrong item*</li>
        <li>Customer no longer needs the item*</li>
        <li>Item is not compatible with other products*</li>
        <li>Customer did not like the color or style*</li>
        <li>
          Customer purchased multiple items to compare and decided to return
          some
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        *These returns might qualify for a restocking fee waiver. Ask a
        supervisor to review the request.

      <h3>Creating an RMA in ShipStation</h3>
      <p>
        First, you will need to locate the order in ShipStation, it is always
        best to use the ADN number as it is automatically included in the
        shipment notes, you may also use the customer's email address to locate
        the order. Once you have found the order follow the steps below:
      </p>
      <div class="flex-container-rma">
        <div class="flex-row">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              Once you have located and opened the order, click on the Returns
              icon in the left-side menu. Here you can see it shows 0 Returns
              for this order.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="image-content-rma">
            <img
              src="images/rma1.jpg"
              alt="ShipsStation Order Screen with Returns selected." />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-row">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              This will open the RETURNS screen. Click on the "+" icon to create
              a new return. This will open a screen that contains the items
              shipped out for the order. Only items that have shipped can be
              processed for an RMA. Lost shipments are not processed under the
              RMA system. Only items that the customer has received and no
              longer want can receive an RMA.
            </p>
          </div>

              Now you will place a check in the box next to the item being
              return. If there are multiple items, use the "Find" feature of
              your browser to search for the SKU number. Once you have select
              the item, be sure to select the correct quantity. ShipStation
              defaults to returning all the items shipped. Then you will pick
              your reason for the return. Once you are finished click "Continue"
              at the bottom right of the screen.
