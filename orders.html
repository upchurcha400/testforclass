      <h1>What to Look For</h1>
      <p>
        While most orders are treated the same there are somethings that might
        make the order require a different treatment. This is why we stress
        entering and reading the order notes. Every employee should check the
        notes section of the orders they are working on. Notes can provide
        valuable information about payment types, shipment requirements, or
        special circumstances surrounding the order.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Below are some examples of special order requirements and where they can
        be found in the system
      </h3>

            In this image, we see the order notes from a Shopify order. The
            Sales Rep. has entered the Credit Card information under the
            'Customer' section (removed for security). The 'Notes' section
            indicates this order is for NFR and requires Overnight Shipping. The
            'Shipping Address' differs from the 'Billing Address' and is
            confirmed as correct for this NFR order.

            In this note section, we can see that this order is a
            <b>"DO NOT SHIP - Pick up"</b> order type. When we process this
            order we will have to mark it with a <b>"DO NOT SHIP" Tag</b> in the
            warehouse software <i>Shipstation</i>. Information like this should
            always be communicated within the notes, and it is everyone
            responsibility to read the notes and process the order accordingly.
