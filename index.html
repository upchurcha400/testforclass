        <h1>Welcome to the American Darling Training Center</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the order processing overview for American Darling, LLC. At
          American Darling, we strive to provide a seamless experience for our
          customers, from the moment they place an order to the final delivery
          of their products. Our efficient systems ensure that every step of the
          order lifecycle is meticulously managed. We utilize three key
          platforms—Shopify, Cin7, and Shipstation—to handle order processing,
          RMA requests, refunds, exchanges, and strap replacements for bags with
          broken straps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our process is built on a one-way flow of information, which is
          crucial for maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Orders are initiated
          in Shopify, where they are created and managed. Once an order is
          confirmed, it seamlessly transitions to Cin7, where invoicing and
          accounting take place. Following this, the order is sent to
          Shipstation for warehouse picking and shipping. It's important to note
          that this flow is one-time only: from Shopify to Cin7, and then from
          Cin7 to Shipstation. The final step involves updating the order status
          back to Shopify for fulfillment marking.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview of the Order Process</h2>
        <p>
          For our sales team, understanding this process is vital. If any
          changes need to be made to an order, they must be manually updated in
          both Shopify and Cin7. Once an order has moved from Shopify to Cin7,
          it will not automatically update, making manual intervention critical
          for maintaining order accuracy. This system ensures that our
          operations run smoothly, allowing us to focus on providing exceptional
          service to our customers. We hope this overview provides clarity on
          our order processing workflow and equips you with the knowledge needed
          to navigate our systems effectively. </p>
          
          <p>Thank you for being a part of the
          American Darling team!

                <td>
                  The comments section can tell you about the payments made and
                  who entered the order. The order notes can give you
                  information about how to process the order (i.e., payment
                  information, shipping information, backorder requests, and
                  purchase order information).

                  Sometimes the customer's file has information that we need to
                  use for all their orders. We try to save payment information
                  in the customer notes.

                  We need to verify that special instructions appear in the
                  correct locations, like shipping instructions for example. We
                  also need to make sure that payment information such as credit
                  card numbers are not in the shipping instructions. If a PO
                  number is required for a purchase, it should appear in the
                  shipping notes for the order.

                  Because the shipping address displayed in the order's
                  drop-down section is the address that will be sent to the
                  shipping software.

                  items we do not have in stock. For website orders, we don't
                  want to pick/pack items we do not have in stock.

                  If the order was marked paid manually in Shopify, a default
                  payment line will appear in Cin7. Payment lines must be

                  We need to send the order to Shipstation so it can be
                  processed by the warehouse. You must SAVE the Ship process,
                  NEVER Authorize. This tells the system that the order is

                  The tags tell the warehouse how to process the order. All paid
                  orders get tagged "AMBER APPROVED", special instructions get
                  tagged "See Office" and overnight orders are tagged "Overnight

                  The notes in Shipstation communicate to the warehouse and the
                  customer important information. We also have to check that
                  shipping notes in Shipstation don't contain sensitive
                  information as it appears on the packing slips placed in the
                  shipment.

                  If you have a special instruction on the order, you need to
                  tell somebody in the warehouse both in WhatsApp and in person.
                  You also need to mark the pick slip with special notes so the
                  person picking the order will know how to process it.
